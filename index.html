    <h3>From the County Manager</h3>
     <h2>To the citizens of Alachua County</h2>
        
        <div class="michel_l">
      <p><img class="michele_mobile" src="images/Michele_300.jpg" width=375  alt="Michele Leiberman"></p>
        <p>Michele Lieberman, County Manager</p>
</div>
        <p>On behalf of the Alachua County Board of County Commissioners (the Board), I am honored to present the 2019 Annual Report, my first as the appointed Alachua County Manager. Our mission is to provide responsive service to citizens and responsible stewardship of county resources for current and future generations. With this mission in mind, I am proud to share the last year’s successes, look forward with determination to next year’s objectives, and identify the challenges we face in meeting those objectives. </p>
        <p>Last year's report highlighted the need to rebuild relationships. I am pleased to report that over the previous 12 months we have made great strides in nurturing civility, trust, and cooperation with our staff, our municipalities, the University of Florida, our constitutional officers, community stakeholders, and citizens. When the inevitable conflicts arise, the process is less contentious, more collaborative, and more professional.</p>
        <div class="boxed_right"><h4>Mission</h4><p>Alachua County’s mission is to provide responsive service to citizens and responsible stewardship of county resources for current and future generations.</p></div>
       <p>This year's report will focus on a simple phrase: "Alachua County: Working for You." It is my privilege to lead almost 1,000 men and women who wake up every morning and focus their energies and talents on working for you.</p>
      <p>An essential part of working for you involves leveraging good relationships and partnerships. Collaborating on projects with our largest municipal partner, the City of Gainesville, is smart. We are making progress on multiple fronts in this partnership. Building on last year's reduction of the County's contribution to the College Park Community Redevelopment Area (CRA), which resulted in almost a million dollars per year returning to the County's General Fund, the County and City have agreed on a consolidation of the four CRAs. This agreement will earmark over $70 million in funding available for transformational projects in East Gainesville and areas of need in the unincorporated area. We are in the early stages of working with the City on projects along the Waldo Road corridor and the Cabot/Koppers Superfund site.</p>
        <div class="boxed_left"><h4>Vision </h4><p>Alachua County is committed to responsible stewardship of the resources entrusted to us by our citizens, realizing that our natural and human resources are our most valuable assets. Furthermore, Alachua County is dedicated to be transparent and responsive, creating an atmosphere of trust with the citizens we serve.</p></div>
       <p>Both the County and the City of Gainesville continue to share the operational costs of Grace Marketplace. This low barrier homeless shelter is on the front line of helping this highly vulnerable population. At a recent meeting, we agreed to shut down the Dignity Village homeless encampment adjacent to the shelter and to fund the creation of camping options within the Grace campus. This action will allow for more proactive case management. Grace is just one step in finding solutions to homelessness in Alachua County. Both the County and the City are determined to continue to look for innovative solutions to the fundamental problem of the lack of affordable housing.</p>
       <p>Another example of successful municipal partnership is the relocation of the Alachua County Fairgrounds. After many years of working to provide a Fairgrounds/Agriculture Center that citizens can be proud of, we are relocating to the former Canterbury Equestrian Center in the City of Newberry. This project includes a new administrative office and community center for the Cooperative Extension Office. The community center will provide a space that is fitting and appropriate for their classes and training programs as well as other community events. We have partnered with the Newberry City Commission to make this a reality.</p>
       <p>The Fairgrounds relocation opens up exciting possibilities for the current fairgrounds site. For decades this site has been underutilized. Many have viewed its redevelopment as an essential piece of the puzzle for economic development in East Gainesville. We are deep into talks with the US Army Reserve 81st Readiness Division about locating an Equipment Concentration Site on this site. If approved, the Army Reserve project will include $30 million in site improvements and 75 jobs with an average salary of $50,000 per year.</p>

       <p>The Board has been clear that nothing is more important than working to ensure that every child has an opportunity for a healthy and productive future. Our Children’s Services division launched three important programs: the NewboRN Home Visit Program, the Transforming Professional Development Program, the Social and Emotional Development Program. The Board further demonstrated their dedication to Alachua County's children by their decision to put the Children's Trust initiative on the 2018 ballot. Much to the credit of our citizens, it passed by a substantial majority. The Trust has begun meeting regularly and is laying the groundwork for putting their structure in place in anticipation of the property tax collections starting in October of 2019. The Children’s Trust will have ten members. Five members were appointed by law and are currently serving and the remaining five will be appointed by the Governor.</p>

       <p>One of our most difficult challenges of the last year has been the number of severe dog attacks that have shocked and saddened our community. The County has worked diligently to improve our procedures, increase our staffing, and strengthen our ordinances to address these unacceptable threats to the public. Our efforts have included:</p>
       
       <ul class="square">
        <li>The Commission approved five new positions (investigators, officers, and a dispatcher).</li>
           <li>The Commission adopted amendments to our Animal Services Ordinance allowing:</li></ul>
         
        <ul class="circle">
        <li>Fines and other penalties to compound if the animal owner has already violated similar municipal codes </li>
        <li>County Attorney authorization to seek injunctive relief for repeated violations of local ordinances within 12 months </li>
        <li>Animal Services to impound dog(s) that are the subject of an aggressive/dangerous dog investigation unless the officer makes a written determination that their owner can safely confine the dog(s)</li>
        <li>That the owner is required to pay a deposit if requesting an aggressive/dangerous dog appeal hearing</li>
            <li>Penalties to more closely reflect the severity of the violations and be better aligned with the City of Gainesville's fee schedule for animal-related code violations</li></ul>
        
         <ul class="square">
        
           
           <li>The Commission approved the Irresponsible Pet Owner amendment to our Animal Services Ordinance allowing:</li>
            </ul>
             <div class="boxed_right_v"><h4>Values</h4><p>To meet our mission, employees should recognize these fundamental values and these values should serve as a guide to employee conduct and actions where policies are silent or in apparent conflict. <br><br>

        Integrity: We adhere to standards of ethical conduct.<br><br>
        Honesty: We are truthful, fair and open with our fellow employees and the people we serve<br><br>
        Respect: We are responsive, compassionate and courteous in all our interactions<br><br>
        Diversity: We embrace the value and power of diversity in our community<br><br>
        Innovation: We are committed to the consideration and implementation of new ideas<br><br>
        Accountability:  We are accountable for our behavior and the quality of work performed individually and as teams<br><br>
        Communication: Our open communication and sharing of ideas enhances the decision-making process
</p></div>
             
        <ul class="circle">
        <li>An owner to be so classified after three violations of certain County ordinances or 2 violations of more severe ordinances, aggressive/dangerous classifications, and/or State statutes within a 3-year period</li>
        <li>Any domestic animals owned by the person must be sterilized within 30 calendar days of the designation as an Irresponsible Pet Owner</li>
         <li>Any domestic animals owned by the person must be microchipped, vaccinated, and properly registered with Animal Services</li>
         <li>The owner must pay a registration fee, annual renewal fee, and will maintain this designation for a period of 3 years</li>
            <li>The Irresponsible Pet Owner may not acquire, own, keep, control, or harbor domestic animals beyond those the person owns, keeps, controls, or harbors at the time of designation</li></ul>
            
            <p>As in past years, maintaining our transportation infrastructure continues to be a significant challenge. The Board understands the importance of making progress with our roads and has augmented Gas Tax dollars with increases in General Fund contributions. In 2015, $1.1 million in General Fund went towards roads. In 2019 that more than tripled to $3.6 million. We are pleased to report on the progress of two of the County's most important arterial roads: Tower Road and NW 43rd Street. Tower Road is completed, and NE 43 Street is near completion. We are making good progress on the SW 8th Avenue connector project.</p>
            
           <p>Our most valuable asset in working for you is our dedicated County staff, who turn the vision of the Board into reality. Over the last year, we have worked hard to strengthen employee morale and trust. Our efforts are working to create an atmosphere that values and respects these men and women. To retain and recruit an outstanding workforce, the Board has supported cost of living increases, innovative training, and individual development programs, and continues to take steps towards paying a living wage. Our goal is to go from $13.50 per hour to $14 in the next fiscal year with the ultimate object of reaching $15 per hour in fiscal year 2022.</p>

       <p>I encourage you to take the time to read this report. It will give you a good understanding of the services provided by your County and what we mean when we say, Alachua County: Working for You. Working for you is our purpose. It defines who we are. With the help of citizens, partners, and stakeholders, we will continue to work to improve and protect our County.</p>

    Two critical hires have taken place recently, the Fire/Rescue Chief and the Growth Management Director. Both of these accomplished individuals came up through the ranks of their respective departments and, after decades of experience and commitment to the County, have earned their leadership positions. These promotions demonstrate to our employees that we reward talent, hard work, and persistence in our organization and that career development is encouraged, nurtured and valued.</p> 
     
    <p>Communicating how we are working for you is always at the forefront of our efforts. All of our departments do an excellent job of keeping the public informed. Departments also do well in communicating with stakeholders who are particularly affected by certain issues. We use our website, Cox Channel 12, social media, video productions, press releases, our newsletter, and many other tools to keep you informed. Social media has become increasingly important, particularly in the case of emergencies. Currently, the County has 76,746 Facebook "LIKES", 8,877 Twitter "Followers" and 2,042 Instagram "Followers". Many of our departments have their own social media sites that cater to citizens with specific interests.</p> 
    <P>We are always exploring how technology upgrades can help us better serve our citizens and employees. Upgrades over the last year include:</P>

    <ul class="square">
        <li>Developed a new in-house application for the administration and tracking of emergency shelter populations for use during a disaster activation</li>
    <li>Implemented New World software for budget,      employee benefits, and human resources
        Completed the redesign of the "News" section of the website to improve how we keep citizens informed</li>
        <li> Completed the Hazardous Waste Collection Center Point of Sale application that tracks and processes the payments from citizens that drop off hazardous waste at Alachua County collection centers </li>
        <li>Replaced the aging in-house Policy Management System with an updated version that runs in the County's new Skillport training module</li>

    <p>
        The most important way we work for you is evidenced each year by the budgetary priority given to public safety. Our funding of the Sheriff, the Jail, and Fire/Rescue make up the largest portion of your tax dollars.</p>
    <p>
        We were very fortunate last year that the devastation that     accompanied Hurricane Michael spared Alachua County. We were    incredibly proud of our response to our neighbors to the       northwest. Alachua County Fire Rescue was a crucial partner in assisting in the aftermath with 20 EMT's and Paramedics deployed for two weeks as a Rescue Strike Team. The team consisted of our Mobile Support Unit Bus, three ambulances, and six additional employees who established a radio communication system and tower for the entire region with our Mobile Area Radio Command Unit.
</p> 
      
    <h5>SUCCESSES</h5>
    <ul class="square">
    <li>Opened Rescue 28 in Newberry</li>
    <li>Transitioned to a Special Assessment to fund Fire Services</li>
    <li>Purchased property for FS80 Engine Relocation</li>
    <li>Completed Phase 1 of the 800-megahertz trunked radio system replacement</li>

        <li>Completed enhanced technology and communication in the 9-1-1 center and the Emergency Operations Center</li>

        <li>Received several grants to expand and enhance our Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program, equipment to protect our employees for enhanced medical care during active shooter incidents, and building enhancements to our Loften Training Center</li>

        <li>NBC’s Today Show featured one of our firefighters, bringing national attention to our department</li>

    <p>
    Another meaningful way we work for you is in the wise and thoughtful stewardship of dollars from voter-approved tax referendums.  With funding from the Wild Spaces Public Places ballot measure passed in 2016, we have acquired 1396 acres of new conservation land.  The County has acquired three valuable conservation land parcels:  Four Creeks Preserve, Serenola Forest, and Fox Pen Preserve.   These properties total 1396 acres, 949 acres paid for by the County and 447 acres paid for by our partners, Alachua Conservation Trust and the City of Gainesville. </p>

    <p>Our goal is not just to acquire property, but to also make it accessible to the public with the addition of trails and informational kiosks. Over the next year, we plan to open Four Creeks Preserve, Turkey Creek Preserve, Watermelon Pond Preserve, and Balu Forest for public enjoyment.</p>

    <h3>Sustainable Stewardship</h3>

    <p>
    When it comes to protecting people and our environment, lines on a map don't matter. Counties are responsible for the protection of our water, air, and most importantly, our citizens: municipal residents and unincorporated residents alike.  While this can be contentious at times, the Board has shown strong leadership in this effort. This leadership is all the more important as we witness diminishing state and federal environmental protection efforts in recent years.  It is the County's responsibility to fulfill our state-mandated obligations to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels into local springs, creeks, lakes, and rivers and resolve conflicts between private interests and the public good.</p>

    <p>We are making considerable progress in instituting essential environmental protections.  Each of the following items came about as a result of a very inclusive process that included multiple meetings with the Board, staff, stakeholders, and the general public. Our successes included:</p> 
    
     <ul class="square">
        <li>Adopting the Countywide Stormwater Quality Code to reduce pollution discharges to groundwater, springs, creeks, lakes, and rivers</li>
        <li>Adopting the Countywide Wetland Protection Code to protect surface water and wetland systems throughout the County, reducing water pollution and improving local resiliency to extreme flooding and drought conditions </li>
        <li> Strengthening the Countywide Water Quality Code to further reduce water pollution from landscape fertilizer, stormwater, and irrigation systems by further inclusion of best design and maintenance practices </li>
        <li>Continued progress on the Newnans Lake watershed restoration including installation of filtration weirs for phosphorus removal</li>
        <li>Completing stormwater treatment retrofit projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of low impact design practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>infrastructure/capital improvements</h3>

    <p>
    As mentioned earlier in this report, the Board understands the importance of making progress on the maintenance of our roads.  Declining transportation infrastructure is not just an Alachua County issue; it is a nationwide challenge. While voters have approved tax initiatives for land conservation, healthcare, schools, public buildings, and parks, using an infrastructure sales tax for transportation has been voted down three times. We continue to work on the prioritized list of projects, but innovative strategies will be necessary if we are to catch up and stay current with repaving, maintenance, and repair projects</p>

    <p>For both the convenience and well-being of the public and our employees, our vertical infrastructure needs to be high functioning, convenient, and safe.   With the aging of County buildings such as the Wilson Building, and the Growth Management Building, maintenance and repair costs continue to skyrocket and are approaching at the point of diminishing return. The Commission has approved moving forward in a deliberate process to solve current, and future space needs problems. The most intriguing possibility is the construction of a new County Administration Building that would allow consolidation of downtown departments and a one-stop-shopping location for these county services.  We are exploring possible space-needs solutions that include our existing properties, collaboration with other governmental agencies, and partnering with the private sector. </p>

    <p>
   One of our best tools for stimulating economic growth is the Tourist Development Tax (TDT). Paid by visitors to the County, this year the tax raised over $5.5 million; the highest total in the history of the tax.  For decades this revenue has been used for capital projects such as the UF Performing Arts Center, Champions Park in Newberry, the Cade Museum, and many others.  It has been used to bring in sporting events and to support cultural and natural attractions and events. </p>

    <p>We are very excited by the many economic development opportunities that are in the works countywide.  The County supports sustainable economic development and smart growth. It is important for us to make the process of working with the County as efficient and customer friendly as possible. We are working for you in this effort through the implementation of a new software program for building permitting, codes enforcement, development review, and zoning.  Once getting through the transition period, this new software will improve customer service and staff efficiency.</p>

    The State mandates that counties provide social services to their residents.  Working with many partners, both governments and non-profits, these services are a crucial way we work for you.  Helping those most in need is not only the compassionate thing to do, but it also makes financial sense.  By helping people through difficult challenges, we ultimately benefit the entire community by fostering productive and contributing members of society.</p>

    <p>To this end, we served over 41,466 people through various community programs to address and lessen the impact of poverty, shelter and feed the homeless and hungry, assisted victims of crime, advocated for veterans and supported youth, seniors and those in crisis.</p>
